The Date Validator Utility is a Python-based project designed to validate date formats and verify whether a given date falls within a specified date range. The project emphasizes clean code structure, proper exception handling, and reliability through automated testing.

The core functionality is implemented in a reusable Python module, while correctness is ensured using both pytest and unittest frameworks. This dual testing approach demonstrates practical knowledge of software testing methodologies and best practices.

Over the project serves as a lightweight yet effective solution for date validation tasks and as a learning-oriented example of Python utility development and test-driven validation.
